## Todo list

- Does it make sense to create 2 cloudfronts? One for the app and one for the api?
- Check if deploy pipeline is logging secrets
- Start company accounting spreadhsheet
- My cloudfront is caching the responses as if they were static files
- We need to use a different cloudfront for api and app
